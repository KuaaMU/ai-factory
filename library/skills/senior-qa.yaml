category: engineering
description: "Comprehensive test strategy design and execution covering unit, integration, end-to-end, and exploratory testing. Emphasizes risk-based test prioritization and context-driven methodology."

capabilities:
  - "Test strategy design based on risk analysis and product context"
  - "Test pyramid optimization (unit, integration, E2E ratio balancing)"
  - "Exploratory testing session design and execution"
  - "Test automation framework selection and architecture"
  - "Performance and load testing design"
  - "Test coverage analysis and gap identification"

use_cases:
  - "Building test strategy for a new product or feature"
  - "Improving test coverage and reducing regression risk"
  - "Setting up test automation infrastructure"
  - "Pre-release quality assessment and sign-off"
  - "Performance testing before scaling events"
  - "Post-incident testing gap analysis"
