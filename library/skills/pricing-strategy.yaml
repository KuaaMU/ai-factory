name: "Pricing Strategy"
category: business
description: "Systematic approach to pricing products and services based on willingness-to-pay research, value metrics, competitive positioning, and packaging optimization. Covers freemium, tiered, usage-based, and hybrid models."

capabilities:
  - "Willingness-to-pay analysis using Van Westendorp and Gabor-Granger methods"
  - "Value metric identification (what unit should pricing be based on)"
  - "Tier design and feature packaging optimization"
  - "Competitive pricing analysis and positioning"
  - "Freemium vs free trial vs paid-only model evaluation"
  - "Price sensitivity testing and elasticity estimation"

use_cases:
  - "Setting initial pricing for a new product launch"
  - "Optimizing existing pricing to increase revenue or conversion"
  - "Designing freemium conversion funnel"
  - "Evaluating pricing model change (flat to usage-based)"
  - "Competitive response when a rival changes pricing"
  - "International pricing and purchasing power parity adjustments"

    description: "Four-question survey to find acceptable price range"
    questions:
      - "At what price would this be too expensive to consider?"
      - "At what price would this be so cheap you'd question quality?"
      - "At what price would this start to feel expensive but still worth it?"
      - "At what price would this be a great deal?"
    output: "Optimal price point, acceptable range, and stress points"

  value_metric_selection:
    criteria:
      - "Aligns with the value customers receive"
      - "Grows as the customer grows (expansion revenue)"
      - "Easy for the customer to understand and predict"
      - "Easy to measure and enforce technically"
    examples:
      - "Per seat (Slack, Figma)"
      - "Per usage (AWS, Twilio)"
      - "Per feature tier (most B2B SaaS)"
      - "Per outcome (performance marketing tools)"

  packaging_principles:
    - "Good/Better/Best: 3 tiers that serve distinct segments"
    - "80% of revenue should come from the middle tier"
    - "Each tier upgrade should feel like a clear step up in value"
    - "Free tier must be genuinely useful but limited in a natural way"

output_format: "Pricing recommendation with value metric analysis, tier structure, pricing points with confidence ranges, competitive positioning map, and implementation roadmap."
