name: "Pre-Mortem Analysis"
category: strategy
description: "Structured pre-mortem exercise that assumes the project has failed and works backward to identify the most likely causes. Combines Munger's inversion, prospective hindsight, and risk matrix prioritization."

capabilities:
  - "Facilitated pre-mortem brainstorming with structured inversion prompts"
  - "Risk categorization across technical, market, team, financial, and regulatory dimensions"
  - "Probability and impact scoring for each identified risk"
  - "Mitigation strategy design for top risks"
  - "Kill criteria definition: conditions under which the project should be abandoned"
  - "Monitoring plan: leading indicators that signal risk materialization"

use_cases:
  - "Before committing resources to a new product or feature"
  - "Before a major architectural decision or technology migration"
  - "Before a product launch or market entry"
  - "When the team is unanimously optimistic (groupthink detection)"
  - "Before fundraising or major financial commitments"
  - "Quarterly strategic review of ongoing initiatives"

process:
  - stage: 1
    name: "Future Failure Assumption"
    description: "Assume the project has failed spectacularly 12 months from now. Set the stage emotionally."
  - stage: 2
    name: "Individual Failure Ideation"
    description: "Each participant independently lists 5-10 reasons why it failed. No discussion yet."
  - stage: 3
    name: "Aggregation and Clustering"
    description: "Collect all failure reasons. Cluster into categories: technical, market, team, financial, regulatory, competitive."
  - stage: 4
    name: "Probability and Impact Scoring"
    description: "Score each risk on probability (1-5) and impact (1-5). Calculate risk score = probability x impact."
  - stage: 5
    name: "Top Risk Deep Dive"
    description: "For the top 5 risks by score, analyze root causes, early warning signs, and cascading effects."
  - stage: 6
    name: "Mitigation Design"
    description: "For each top risk, design specific, actionable mitigation strategies with owners and deadlines."
  - stage: 7
    name: "Kill Criteria"
    description: "Define 3-5 measurable conditions that would indicate the project should be stopped."
  - stage: 8
    name: "Monitoring Plan"
    description: "Identify leading indicators for each top risk. Set up regular check-ins to review."

output_format: "Pre-mortem report with categorized risks, risk matrix visualization, top risk deep dives, mitigation strategies with owners, kill criteria, and monitoring dashboard specification."
